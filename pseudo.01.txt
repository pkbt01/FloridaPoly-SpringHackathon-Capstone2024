DATA:
    Sample rate.
    Sample window size.

    Active sensor reading stack:
        Boolean pointer that the sensor thread can safely write to.
        Has a maximum size dependant on the sample window size and sample rate.
    User-readable sensor reading array:
        Read-only boolean pointer that is periodically overwritten by the sensor thread.
        Represents a window of samples from the sensor.
        Shares the same size as the active reading stack.
        Used to calculate RPM.

LOOP:
    Read sensor pin:
        Add the reading to the sensor reading stack.
        Once the stack fills, copy it into a read-only array and clear the stack.
        Repeat.

EXTERNAL:
    Calculate RPM:
        Iterate over the reading array and count the number of rising-edge state changes (i.e. from false to true)
        Use the following equation to find RPM:
            RPM = 60 * STATE_CHANGES / (CHANGES_PER_ROTATION * SAMPLE_WINDOW_LENGTH)
